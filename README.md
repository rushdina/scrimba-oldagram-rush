# 📸 Oldagram

A solo project from the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j).  
This project is an **Instagram clone** showcasing epic self-portraits from amazing artists. Posts are dynamically rendered using JavaScript from an array, allowing the page to scale to any number of posts while remaining semantic and accessible.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6)

## 🚀 Features
- Dynamically renders all posts from a JavaScript array.
- Displays artist avatar, name, location, post image, likes, and comments.
- Semantic HTML elements: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`.
- Hover effects for action icons: heart, comment, and DM.
- Interactive likes: increment when clicking the heart or double-clicking the post image.
- Responsive layout using Flexbox.

## 🧠 What I Learned / Process
- Practiced DOM manipulation and dynamic rendering using arrays and loops.
- Implemented event listeners for multiple interactive elements (buttons and images).
- Applied semantic HTML for accessibility.
- Styled posts using Flexbox and hover effects for interactivity.

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add comment functionality.
- Add like/unlike toggle.
- Store likes in local storage so counts persist on page reload.
- Implement infinite scrolling for more posts.
